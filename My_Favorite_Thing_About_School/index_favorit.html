    <title>My Favorite Thing About School</title>

<h1>What I enjoy in school</h1>

<body>
    <p> I love playing volleyball
        <br> So, my favorite thing in school would be playing on the school team with my friends
        <h2>Why do I like Volleyball?</h2>
        <p>It is a game filled with techniques and requires you to be engaged.
            <br> The intensity of the game and that satisfaction as you make a good pass, serve, hit, or block keeps me playing.
            <br> Though I just started last year, my goal is to hopefully make it onto varsity.
            <br> Or, if not varsity, just a great player on the junior varsity team.
