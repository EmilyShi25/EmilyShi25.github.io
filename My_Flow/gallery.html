        <p>Here are a couple images of my drawings!</p>
        <p>This is an image of a sphere ontop of a cube.
            <br>it is actually my first official sketch and took a long time.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>This is an image of a wine bottle, apple, egg and plate</p>

        <p>The plate isn't as noticable as I would like for it to be.
            <br> But because I am really slow at drawing, I will work on it when I have time

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>This is an image of my latest sketches, it is a mouth.
            <br> Except the mouth is drawn from a clay statue, you'd have to know that its a mouth to see it as one.

        <p>I am almost done with the drawing but still have to add the shadows in the background and everything.</p>
