        <h3>Here are some movies that I've enjoyed a lot (many are from studio ghibli)</h3>
        <h2>Totoro</h2>
        <p>I've watched totoro about twice
            <br>At first, I liked the movie but thought of it as quite odd.
            <br>Thinking about it now, I really appreciate the creativity.
            <br>The artwork is also stunning, this is one of the movies that I would not skip through, no matter what.

        <h2>Kiki's delivery service</h2>
        <p> Kiki's delivery service is the first movie that came to mind when I though of studio ghibli.
            <br>This movie really started the basis of my love for studio ghibli.
            <br>Though I find it hard to pick a favorite, Kiki's delivery service is the one I will remember forever.

        <br>
        <h2>Spirited Away</h2>
        <p>I've watched spirited away about three times
            <br>Most recently would be at middle school for something similar to EBC week (watching films).
            <br>When I first watched it, I was scared bu intruiged (I was a fearful child).
            <br>The whole turning into pigs, big babies, no face, and giant owl witch did freak me out.
            <br>But because the story telling was so great, Spirited away made a lasting impact on me.
            <br>I still remember everything and love the movie.
