            <br>Nuclear Plants make up 10% of the energy we use as of right now.
            <br>Many of them a built before the 2000s (1970 - 1990) and often use a reactor called light water.
            <br>There are many different types of reactors but this one is cheap and easy to make.
            <br>Which is why it is so popular.
            <br>If you may not know, nuclear reactors produce energy by nuclear fission.

            <br>What happens here is that the nucleus of an atom is split into pieces, and during this process, there is a BANG
            <br>Which, generates a lot of energy and radiation.
            <br>They use this energy to heat water and create electricity.
            <br>Uranium is used to create these bangs and their fuel lasts about 8 years.
            <br>After their life span runs out, they are still emitting radiation.
            <br>Luckily water is good at supressing the radiation. But with radiation is heat.
            <br>To make sure that the water doesn't boil out, there is power that is constantly cooling the water.
            <br>Without that power, the water will boil and cause a huge BANG in the building.
