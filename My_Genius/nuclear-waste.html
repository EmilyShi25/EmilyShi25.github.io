            <br>Nuclear waste contains extreme amount of radiation, that will cause cancer if you are exposed to an extreme amount.
            <br>Some are contained in buildings with water control, some are contained anti-radiation containers.

            <br>Radiation lasts for hundreds of millions years, so it will likely still be there when the human civilization extincts.
            <br>To make sure that the radiation does no seep out, it requires maintence by humans.
            <br>But we won't be here forever so there must be a better way to take care of them.
            <br>Sweden is currently building an underground nuclear waste sight. Once radiation is put in, it will be sealed off.
            <br>Its so far deep down that the radiation won't affect the eart above, and once its sealed off, it will never be opened again.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>But for future civilizations, they need to warn them about the dangers of that area.
            <br>Because there is a door that openes to this underground facility.
            <br>There would be extreme dangers if the door were to open.
            <br>So, they are also currently working on warnings.
