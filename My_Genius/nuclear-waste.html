        <h1>Nuclear Waste and Solutions</h1>
        <p>
            <br>Nuclear waste contains extreme amount of radiation, that have of high chance of causing cancer if you are exposed to an extreme amount.
            <br>Some are contained in buildings with water control as show in the introduction, some are contained anti-radiation containers.
        </p>
        <p>This is an image of nuclear waste in containers and nuclear waste that is in a pool with cooling systems.</p>

        <p>
            <br>Radiation lasts for hundreds of thousands of years, so it might still linger around even when the human species extincts.
            <br>To make sure that the radiation does no seep out, it requires maintence by humans.
            <br>But we won't be here forever so there must be a better way to take care of them.
            <br>Sweden is currently building an underground nuclear waste sight. Once radiation is put in, it will be sealed off.
            <br>Its so far deep down that the radiation won't affect the eart above, and once its sealed off, it will never be opened again.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>But for future civilizations, they need to warn them about the dangers of that area.
            <br>Because there is a door that openes to this underground facility.
            <br>There would be extreme dangers if the door were to open.
            <br>So, they are also currently working on warnings.
