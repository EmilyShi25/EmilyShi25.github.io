            <h4 style="color: white">GANYU:</h4>
            <p>Ganyu is currently the secretary of an organization</p>
            <p>She is a half adeptus which makes her different from the other character: Xiao.</p>
            <p>She has quite the shy personality and often likes to mention her work.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="playstyle">
            <h4 style="color: white">PLAYSTYLE:</h4>
            <p>She is a bow character with a really high attack damage.</p>
            <p>Her skill and bursts freezes people and her charged attack can deal a lot of damage. The skill is a frozen flower petal that bursts after around 10-20 seconds. Her burst are a bunch of hail falling down in a certain radius.</p>
            <p>She is really good as a support but could also be your main</p>
            <p>You could run her in a freeze team or a melt team</p>
            <p>A character that would go really well with her would be Zhongli</p>
        </div>
        <div class="compare">
            <h4 style="color: white">COMPARISON:</h4>
            <p>In the current set up that I have of ganyu, her charged attack deals most of the damage</p>
            <p>Interestingly, if I were to level her talents up more, she would have the same damage as the bursts for xiao. Xiao's elemental skill usually does more damage than ganyu's skill, but his charged attack is weaker.</p>
