            <h4 style="color: white">XIAO:</h4>
            <p>Xiao is an adeptus that used to be the puppet/enslaved by an evil god. He now wanders freely where-ever he wants. However, during a battle, he lost all of his friends which is why you can hear him whistling a tune to his deceased friends at
                night in the game.</p>
            <p>Xiao is also quite reserved/introverted and likes being alone. Though he puts up an act of always being annoyed, Xiao still has a warm side deep down.</p>
            <p>He also really likes tofu.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="playstyle">
            <h4 style="color: white">PLAYSTYLE:</h4>
            <p>Xiao is a spear user and has the special ability to plunge from anywhere without losing hp. He has an anemo vision, which is basically like wind. His skill has the ability of teleportation/very quick movement allowing him to pierce through
                enemies in the split of a second. Xiao's bursts consists of him jumping very high and plunging down. This does significant damage each time and adds up to a very high number. However, in this process xiao loses hp. So, a character like
                bennet (healer) would keep Xiao alive and also increase his damage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="compare">
            <h4 style="color: white">COMPARISON:</h4>
            <p>Xiao's normal attacks and charged aren't as good as his skill or bursts contrary to ganyu. His skills and bursts are stronger than that of ganyu's but ganyu's charge attack does significant damage. You have to be careful of his hp so a healer
                on his team would be better than a shielder like Zhongli. Xiao is a great main and does amazing with any element since he is an anemo. Ganyu also does well with other elements however anemo can take the form of the elements that they come
                into contact with, making it more useful in certain situations.</p>
