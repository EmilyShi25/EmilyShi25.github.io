            <!-- so the alt z makes the formatting here look weird -->
            <p>Genshin Impact is a game that gained traction almost three years ago. It is a story/journey like game focused around a twin trying to find their other half. The main character of the game goes into a new world, meeting new allies, enemies,and
                friends.
            </p>

            <p>The journey consists of finding clues, solving puzzles, and most importantly, fighting bosses. The game is continuous and will likely add on for many more years to come. Right now, players have many characters to choose from (5 stars and 4
                stars). I personally have found two characters that are fun to play and would like to discuss them: Xiao and Ganyu, both are five star characters.</p>
