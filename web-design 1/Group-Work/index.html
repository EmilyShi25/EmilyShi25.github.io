    Short Paragraph: 
    This project I felt that I challenged myself with exploring many different new features that I always thought to use but never did.
    In a way I am greatful for the extra class-day that we got to work on this because I got to add buttons for my links.
    I was familiar with grid in python but I got to explore more of what I could do with the grid.
    I do want to do more with grid and make the page more fancy but time-wise I felt that it wouldn't be for the best.
    The design of this website did challenge me, with what color I should go with and how things should be placed to make this website look better
    The boder-radius in my opinion was of great help to pulling things together and I am glad that I found it. 
    However, even though this was a huge step-up from the websites I've made so far, there are still many areas that I would like to alter and experiment with. 
    One of the most challenging things in this project is communication. Because we cannot change things on other people's pages it makes it hard to fix problems effectively.
    So, I was wondering if there are ways to solve this problem.
