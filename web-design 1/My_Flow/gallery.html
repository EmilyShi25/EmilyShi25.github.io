        <p>Here are a couple images of my drawings!</p>
        <p>This is an image of a sphere ontop of a cube.
            <br>Tt is actually my first official sketch and took a long time.

        <br>
        <p>This is an image of a wine bottle, apple, egg and plate</p>

        <p>The plate isn't as noticable as I would like for it to be.
            <br> But because I am really slow at drawing, I will work on it when I have time
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>This is an image of my latest sketches, it is a mouth.
            <br> Except the mouth is drawn from a clay statue, you'd have to know that its a mouth to see it as one.

        <p>I am almost done with the drawing but still have to add the shadows in the background and everything.</p>

        <p>Here is the image that inspired the color theme of this webpage. This picture was a lot livelier than the ones I took.
            <br>So, I wanted to use it.

        <p>I used triadic colors from this color palete.
            <br>I want this website to display a calmer of youthful vibe. (The pink is a little darker, so that there is also a hint of warmth)
