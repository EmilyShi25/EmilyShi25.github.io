            <br>When there are such things like a nuclear plant explosion or a dropped atomic bomb where there are mass levels of radiation released,
            <br>there is fallout. Fallouts are basically radioactive particles. They can be carried by wind to places far from the explosion site.
            <br>Radiation levels decrease significantly within the first 48 hours. So, you can go outside.
            <br>But, if you are within a certain radius of the explosion you will have to evacuate.
            <br>Here we have few images in relation to nuclear energy, uranium, and protection against radiation.
        </p>
        <p>This is an image of what many nuclear plants look like on the outside.
            <br>Through all the smoke they still produce the second to least amount of carbon emissions.

        <p>Image of nuclear Reactor. The large tank to the very left is where the uranium is inserted.
            <br>This is a pressurized water reactor and not a light water reactor but it is also quite common.

        <p>Image of an old design for radiation fallout shelters during the cold war. You don't need to build one like this.
            <br>But generally, it is good to be underground when there is radiation fallout. Steel is also good at blocking radiation.
