        <h1>Nuclear Waste and What it is</h1>
        <p>
            <br>Nuclear Plants make up 10% of the energy we use in the world as of right now
            <br>And are considered the second cleanest energy source after wind mills.
            <br>Many of them a built before the 2000s (1970 - 1990) and often use a reactor called light water.
            <br>There are many different types of reactors but this one is cheap and easy to make.
            <br>Which is why it is so popular. But nuclear plants results in something that coupd potentially be extremely toxic.
            <br>If you may not know, nuclear reactors produce energy by nuclear fission.
        </p>

        <p>
            <br>What happens here is that the nucleus of an atom is split into pieces, this process creates a huge BANG.
            <br>Which, generates a lot of energy.
            <br>They use this energy to heat water and create electricity.
            <br>Uranium is used to create these bangs and their fuel lasts about 8 years.
            <br>After their life span runs out, they are still able to emit energy, in the form of radiation.
            <br>The uranium waste is then usually put into pools that resides within the nuclear power plants.
            <br>Water is good at supressing radiation and uses the energy from the nuclear reactor to cool the water.
            <br>This is because like stated earlier, the uranium can still omitt energy, or you can call it, heat.
            <br>If the temperature gets too high and the water boils out, high radiation will be released
            <br>
            <br>

        <p>I created this website for nuclear waste because it is something that I have been interested in but never researched.
            <br>I realized that I wanted to teach my biology class on nuclear waste for my biology final and it is something that I have a lot of fun researching
            <br>So, I thought that it would be fun if I created a website for it.
            <br>I am still in the early stages of researching so there isn't that much information yet, but this website will grow soon.
            <br>For now, I hope you enjoy the brief intro I have on nuclear waste and radiation!
